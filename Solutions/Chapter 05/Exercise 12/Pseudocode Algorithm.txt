Solution to exercises from "C# How to Program 6th edition".
Chapter 5.

Exercise 12(05) (05.21) Find the Largest Number.

Notice.
    My version of the textbook has some strange numeration at 5th chapter's exercises, the first part of the number starts from the beginning after Exercise 7, so I decide to continue numeration as if it would not be changed and put number from the book in paranthesis.

First pseudocode statement that conveys an overall purpose of the application.
    Find the largest number from the row of ten numbers.

First refinement.
    Initialize variables.
    
    Read values from user and calculate the largest one.
    
    Print the results.

Second refinement.
    Print a welcome message.
    
    Set counter to 1.
    Set number to 0.
    Set largest to 0.
    
    Read the first number and write it to the largest.
    
    While counter is less than or equal to 9:
        Read the next number from user.
        If the next number is larger than the largest:
            Write the number to the largest.
        Increment counter by 1.
    
    Print the largest number.
    
    Print a farewell message.
