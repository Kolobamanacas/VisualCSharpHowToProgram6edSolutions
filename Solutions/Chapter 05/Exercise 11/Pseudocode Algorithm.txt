Solution to exercises from "C# How to Program 6th edition".
Chapter 5.

Exercise 11(04) (05.20) Salary Calculator.

Notice.
    My version of the textbook has some strange numeration at 5th chapter's exercises, the first part of the number starts from the beginning after Exercise 7, so I decide to continue numeration as if it would not be changed and put number from the book in paranthesis.
