Solution to exercises from "C# How to Program 6th edition".
Chapter 5.

Exercise 08(01) (05.17) Gas Mileage.

Notice: my version of the textbook has some strange numeration at 5th chapter's exercises, the first part of the number starts from the beginning after Exercise 7, so I decide to continue numeration as if it would not be changed and put number from the book in paranthesis.

First pseudocode statement that conveys an overall purpose of the application.
    Determine the mile per gallon usage for orbitrary number of tankfuls and their totals based on gallons used and miles driven input.

First refinement.
    Initialize variables.
   
    Read miles driven and gallons used for arbitrary number of tankfuls and print miles per gallon usage for every tankful following by combined miles per gallon to the point.

Second refinement.
    Set total number of tankfuls to zero.
    Set total number of miles per gallon to zero.

    Read miles driven for the first tankful.

    While miles driven for cureent tankful is non equal to -1.
        Read gallons used for the first tankful.
        Increment tankfuls count.
        Print miles per gallon usage for current tankful.
        Add miles per gallon usage of current tankful to total usage.
        Print total miles per gallon usage to the point.
        Read miles driven for the next tankful.
