Exercise 13 (03.19).
    It displays some kind of pyramid. Like that:
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
   
Exercise 14 (03.20).
    It displays pretty strange pyramid this time. It looks like that:
    *
    ***
    *****
    ****
    **

Exercise 15 (03.21).
    This time it displays 15 asterisks as a line with newline escape sequence in the end:
    ***************

Exercise 16 (03.22).
    It prints three lines with 4, 5 and 6 asterisks respectively. This happens because WriteLine method continues printing characters at the same place where Write method finish. The result is:
    ****
    *****
    ******

Exercise 15 (03.23).
    Again it is some kind of pyramid of asterisks. We inicialize variables of type string with different numbers of asterisks as values and print them with WriteLine method separating each value with a newline escape sequence "\n". The result is:
    *
    ***
    *****
